% Hypothesis

\textbf{Hypothesis:} Improved optimal control tools will allow greater
increases to be made with renewable energy. Can improve optimal control tools
by creating an NLP solver that can take advantage of parallel processing.

% Intelectual Merit

\textbf{Intelectual Merit:} Distributed computing will allow large decreases in
time to compute. Will allow potential for onboard optimal control. Will allow
for solving of bigger problems. Current NLP solvers not designed to take
advantage of parallel processes

% Broader Impact
% ---

\textbf{Broader Impact:} Increased ability to solve optimal control problems.
Fits nicely with naturally distributed problems (ex. electric grid, air traffic
control, etc.). Space processors have to be slow so that they do not overheat
inside their radiation shields and so optimal control will be feasible onboard
if multiple processors are able to be used.
