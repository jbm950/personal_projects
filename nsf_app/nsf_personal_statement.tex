% Background
% --- 

\textbf{Background:} I have just graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University
of Missouri this past spring.

% Schooling 
%   - Outstanding Senior Award
%   - Summa Cum Laude
% Research Already Done
%   - Biggest outcome was learning experience rather than a product.
%       - Learned how fuzzy controlers work and made a basic one
%       - Got an idea of how to organize research work
%       - Became accustomed to reading research articles
%   - Final result was a basic fuzzy logic controller
% Tutor
%   - Improved capabilities to communicate technical information
% --- 
% Thoughts on outline: 
%   - Need to include a direction to the reasoning and motives behind the
%     proposal

% Hypothesis
% ---

\textbf{Hypothesis:} The current optimal control tools can benefit from
distributed computing, however, this is not a capability of current optimal
control tools. By developing an optimal control tool that takes advantage of
distributed computing the NLP solver will be able to operate much faster that
current tools. This will help enable online optimal control in addition to
making the use of optimal control increasingly available for different
audiences.

% SQP method of solving NLP's
%
% Distributed Computing
%   - Reverse communication
%       - Top level file that provides communication between optimizer and
%         function generator
%       - Allows optimizer and function generator to run separately
%           - Both can now be distributed to multiple processors
%   - Gauss Quadriture method used in this lab is inheriently parallelizable
%       - Other methods don't lead to parallelization as easily
%   - Method has not gained much attention yet and is worth expanding
% --- 
% Thoughts on outline: 
% ---
% Improved optimal control tools will allow greater
% increases to be made with renewable energy. Can improve optimal control tools
% by creating an NLP solver that can take advantage of parallel processing.

% Work Plan
% ---

\textbf{Work Plan:} I will begin my work by first gaining increased capability
with current NLP solvers. I will then begin writing my own NLP solver. Once the
solver has been written I work on making it capable of taking advantage of
parallel processing.  The final step will be to optimize the code for speed as
much as possible such that it will be the optimal control solver of choice.

% Steps towards software
%   1. Learn optimization methods and practice with currenly available software 
%       - Will learn basic optimization methods and how they're implemented
%       - Will learn how current tools provide interfaces to solve optimization
%         problems
%   2. Begin work on basic optimizers
%       - Will gain practice actually implementing different NLP solver
%         techniques
%   3. Learn parallel processing
%       - Needed knowledge to create software that can take advantage of
%         multiple processors
%   4. Write optimal control software that uses parallel processing
%       - This will be a combination of the previous steps combining into an
%         optimal control software that is robust and takes advantage of
%         parallel processsing
%   5. Optimize software
%       - With the goal of making the fastest available software optimization
%         techniques will be used to make the code run as fast as possible
%       - Bottlenecks can be re-written in faster languages and integrated into
%         the software
%   6. Distribute software
%       - Make available the software so that it can start to be used 
%       - Write a users manual so that the software is easy to pick up
%       - Write and distribute a paper that goes in depth on how the software
%         works

\textbf{Intelectual Merit:} 

% Optimal Control Tools
% 
% SQP method
%
% Distributed computing
%   - For equivalent processors any tools that can multitask and have different
%     parts of the program run simultaneously will be inheriently faster
% --- 
% Thoughts on outline: 
% ---
% Distributed computing will allow large decreases in
% time to compute. Will allow potential for onboard optimal control. Will allow
% for solving of bigger problems. Current NLP solvers not designed to take
% advantage of parallel processes

% Broader Impact
% ---

\textbf{Broader Impact:} The optimal control tools developed will enable new
systems to be subject to optimal control that would otherwise have been
untractable. This optimal control tool will bring a direct impact towards the
energy sustainability of the nation. In order to move towards complete energy
self sufficiency there will be many products and procedures that will need to
be done in an optimal manner, otherwise they will not have the economic
viablility to be a long term solution. An example of a place optimal control
can be used in renewable energy is the case of wind turbines that are
essentially placed in blimps so that their vertical location can be adjusted to
meet the highest wind speeds. Optimal control can be used in this location in
order to balance moving the turbine to produce maximum electricity while
expending as little energy as possible in the adjustments.

    Another place that will benefit from optimal control tools utilizing
distributed computing is space systems. On space systems the processors
have to be radiation shielded for protection but as a result they can not
be run very fast due to risk of overheating. This means in order to
increase processing speed additional processors are needed to be used. As a
consequence if optimal control is to be run fast enough to be used as online
optimal control then it will need to take advantage of multiple processors.

% Renewable/sustainable energry future
%   - Need to increase amount of renewable energy created
%    OC - Improve efficiency of energy generated
%    OC - Reduce cost of energy generation
%    OC - Increase availability of alternative energy options
%       - Increase awareness of available energy options
%   - Reduce energy usage
%    OC - Design more efficient products
%       - Change current energy usage habits
% Other Examples
%   * Airtrafic control
%       - Naturally distributed system
%       - In order to optimally control flights would need to account for lots
%         of locations across the nation
%   * Space Systems
%       - Restricting on processor speed due to radiation shield
%       - In order to do online optimal control would need multiple processors
% --- 
% Thoughts on outline: 
% ---
% Increased ability to solve optimal control problems.
% Fits nicely with naturally distributed problems (ex. electric grid, air
% traffic control, etc.). Space processors have to be slow so that they do not
% overheat inside their radiation shields and so optimal control will be
% feasible onboard if multiple processors are able to be used.
