% Hypothesis

\textbf{Hypothesis:}

% SQP method of solving NLP's
%
% Distributed Computing
%   - Reverse communication
%       - Top level file that provides communication between optimizer and
%         function generator
%       - Allows optimizer and function generator to run separately
%           - Both can now be distributed to multiple processors
%   - Gauss Quadriture method used in this lab is inheriently parallelizable
%       - Other methods don't lead to parallelization as easily
%   - Method has not gained much attention yet and is worth expanding

% Dissemination
% ---

\textbf{Dissemination:}

% Put software on github and Pypi so that everyone as access to it for free
%
% Write a user manual with examples and make this available on github also
%
% Write paper to be published in Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics

% Contingency Plans

\textbf{Contingency Plans:}

% This section might not have as much use in a topic proposal such as this one
%   - More useful when having a step by step proposal where the steps are
%     dependent on the previous step being correct
% Could use in the event that distributed computing does not offer a signiicant
%     advantage to singular computing
